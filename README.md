The documentation for watching 10 Nic Cadge movies and then rating them on their cageness

I have been given the challenge of watching 10 Nic Cage movies this year and then rating them on the following aspects:
* Enjoyability
* Artistic Merit
* The Cageness of the movie.

## Willy's Wonderland - Synapsis

First up this year. A wonderful story about a bunch of possessed Satanic animetronic robots at an old Chuck E Cheese style kids party restaurant that are unfortunately trapped inside of it with Nicholas Cage...

This was probably one of the worst and yet best movies that I have watched in some time. I have not watched a truly terrible yet wonderful movie like this in some large amount of time and this was a wonderful way to start this little challenge.

I would recommend watching this one. This is something that you would watch when you want just would like to not give a damn about the movie being good but want to watch some violence in a B horror movie.

### Enjoyability
9/10
I fucking loved this movie. It was bad, it was fun and it was hilarious to watch. I do not think that there is any reason to watch it more than one time but I would for sure recommend this masterpiece of a bad movie for someone to watch without hesitation.

### Artistic Merit
1/10
Alright, I loved this movie but there is little here for artistic merit to speak. I would call this a pretty low on the art but high on the enjoyability

### The Cageness
Fucking 10 out of 10. He is both hinged and completely unhinged at the same time in this movie. He literally never say anything in this movie past the occasional grunt and maybe some happy noise when he is playing the pinball machine between murdering these helpless robots in the movie. 

I think that the best part of the Cageness in this movie is the Cage stare. You get it I think about every 10 to 15 minutes at minimum and it is just amazing.
