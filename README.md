The documentation for watching 10 Nic Cadge movies and then rating them on their cageness

I have been given the challenge of watching 10 Nic Cage movies this year and then rating them on the following aspects:
* Enjoyability
* Artistic Merit
* The Cageness of the movie.

## Willy's Wonderland - Synapsis

First up this year. A wonderful story about a bunch of possessed Satanic animetronic robots at an old Chuck E Cheese style kids party restaurant that are unfortunately trapped inside of it with Nicholas Cage...

This was probably one of the worst and yet best movies that I have watched in some time. I have not watched a truly terrible yet wonderful movie like this in some large amount of time and this was a wonderful way to start this little challenge.

I would recommend watching this one. This is something that you would watch when you want just would like to not give a damn about the movie being good but want to watch some violence in a B horror movie.

### Enjoyability
9/10
I fucking loved this movie. It was bad, it was fun and it was hilarious to watch. I do not think that there is any reason to watch it more than one time but I would for sure recommend this masterpiece of a bad movie for someone to watch without hesitation.

### Artistic Merit
1/10
Alright, I loved this movie but there is little here for artistic merit to speak. I would call this a pretty low on the art but high on the enjoyability

### The Cageness
Fucking 10 out of 10. He is both hinged and completely unhinged at the same time in this movie. He literally never say anything in this movie past the occasional grunt and maybe some happy noise when he is playing the pinball machine between murdering these helpless robots in the movie. 

I think that the best part of the Cageness in this movie is the Cage stare. You get it I think about every 10 to 15 minutes at minimum and it is just amazing.

## Lord of War

Well, this was something that I really did not need in my life right now but none the less it was a Cage movie and it was free to me so... That is why I watched this. I know that I watched this at some point in the past but I really did not remember anything about it.

This movie is ones of those things that if you have had enough of reality is probably not the uplifting movie that you would want to watch as it is based on real some real people and events in the real world and the end of the movie is mostly there to remind you that if you live in the USA that you government is pretty evil too and that is something that hits way too hard now with how things have been going politically.

I did like this in its own way but I would have to be in the right mood for something like this that is more about telling a story and making a point. 

**BEGIN SPOILERS**
Alright, moving on past all that, if you have not seen this, this movie is about someone who comes from nothing then becomes a Gun runner and makes it basically to the tippy top of gun running and everything that happens inbetween. In the movie Yuri has a brother that does this work with him and then stops because he is having a mental breakdown from seeing the horror of the things that he has done and the result of his actions and so he starts doing Drugs to get away from that but the mian Character just does not notice that is what is eating at his brother and keeps pulling him back in until that results in the eneviatble end of his brother at the end of the movie. This is something that you feel is coming the who movie and just when his brother got his life together the main character pulls him back in for one more time even though he really tries not to and ends up getting him killed.

Past that this movie has the standard trope in a lot of movies where the main character is untouchable and then starts a family that does not know what he does for a living and then eventually find out and leave him. The way that this differs is that they never come back to him and the main character is just an evail and bad person at the end of the movie. You would think that this movie would have the normal redemption arch but no, The main character who you think may realize that he is doing really bad things and that his family is more impotand than liking his job but that only happens for a short moment in the movie and he just can't leave alone.
**END SPOILERS**

### Enjoyability
4/10
I think that depending on who you are and what you are into this number could go up a lot. But for me right now, someone that is mostly looking for lighter things/action things that have no real bearing on the world this was not what I would have been looking for at this moment and time. 

### Artistic Merit
7/10
I think that many parts of this movie have a large amount of artistic merit. The story telling is neat, the scenes in the movie are fitting for all the things that are going on without just being this drab sad hellscape which is what a lot of movies that picture warzones feel like. That being said, 

### The Cageness
6/10
This is interesting, because in the movie the main character is unhinged, but not in the way that I would like to see Cage unhinged. I would normally like that in the silly direction where things are stupid unhinged that lead to the main character doing stuff that normal people would not do. But in this movie that mostly comes from the main character really never getting that he is probably the worst person in the world and that he is the machine that feeds the killing even if he is not the one pulling the trigger. I sota liked this but in the end it is not the type of Cage that I would prefer but it was not bad.

## What is next?
* Season of the Witch?
* Primal?
