The documentation for watching 10 Nic Cadge movies and then rating them on their cageness

I have been given the challenge of watching 10 Nic Cage movies this year and then rating them on the following aspects:
* Enjoyability
* Artistic Merit
* The Cageness of the movie.

## Willy's Wonderland - Synapsis

First up this year. A wonderful story about a bunch of possessed Satanic animetronic robots at an old Chuck E Cheese style kids party restaurant that are unfortunately trapped inside of it with Nicholas Cage...

This was probably one of the worst and yet best movies that I have watched in some time. I have not watched a truly terrible yet wonderful movie like this in some large amount of time and this was a wonderful way to start this little challenge.

I would recommend watching this one. This is something that you would watch when you want just would like to not give a damn about the movie being good but want to watch some violence in a B horror movie.

### Enjoyability - 9/10
I fucking loved this movie. It was bad, it was fun and it was hilarious to watch. I do not think that there is any reason to watch it more than one time but I would for sure recommend this masterpiece of a bad movie for someone to watch without hesitation.

### Artistic Merit - 1/10
Alright, I loved this movie but there is little here for artistic merit to speak. I would call this a pretty low on the art but high on the enjoyability

### The Cageness - Fucking 10 out of 10.
He is both hinged and completely unhinged at the same time in this movie. He literally never say anything in this movie past the occasional grunt and maybe some happy noise when he is playing the pinball machine between murdering these helpless robots in the movie. 

I think that the best part of the Cageness in this movie is the Cage stare. You get it I think about every 10 to 15 minutes at minimum and it is just amazing.

## Lord of War

Well, this was something that I really did not need in my life right now but none the less it was a Cage movie and it was free to me so... That is why I watched this. I know that I watched this at some point in the past but I really did not remember anything about it.

This movie is ones of those things that if you have had enough of reality is probably not the uplifting movie that you would want to watch as it is based on real some real people and events in the real world and the end of the movie is mostly there to remind you that if you live in the USA that you government is pretty evil too and that is something that hits way too hard now with how things have been going politically.

I did like this in its own way but I would have to be in the right mood for something like this that is more about telling a story and making a point. 

**BEGIN SPOILERS**

Alright, moving on past all that, if you have not seen this, this movie is about someone who comes from nothing then becomes a Gun runner and makes it basically to the tippy top of gun running and everything that happens inbetween. In the movie Yuri has a brother that does this work with him and then stops because he is having a mental breakdown from seeing the horror of the things that he has done and the result of his actions and so he starts doing Drugs to get away from that but the mian Character just does not notice that is what is eating at his brother and keeps pulling him back in until that results in the eneviatble end of his brother at the end of the movie. This is something that you feel is coming the who movie and just when his brother got his life together the main character pulls him back in for one more time even though he really tries not to and ends up getting him killed.

Past that this movie has the standard trope in a lot of movies where the main character is untouchable and then starts a family that does not know what he does for a living and then eventually find out and leave him. The way that this differs is that they never come back to him and the main character is just an evail and bad person at the end of the movie. You would think that this movie would have the normal redemption arch but no, The main character who you think may realize that he is doing really bad things and that his family is more impotand than liking his job but that only happens for a short moment in the movie and he just can't leave alone.

### Enjoyability - 4/10

I think that depending on who you are and what you are into this number could go up a lot. But for me right now, someone that is mostly looking for lighter things/action things that have no real bearing on the world this was not what I would have been looking for at this moment and time. 

### Artistic Merit - 7/10

I think that many parts of this movie have a large amount of artistic merit. The story telling is neat, the scenes in the movie are fitting for all the things that are going on without just being this drab sad hellscape which is what a lot of movies that picture warzones feel like. That being said, 

### The Cageness - 6/10

This is interesting, because in the movie the main character is unhinged, but not in the way that I would like to see Cage unhinged. I would normally like that in the silly direction where things are stupid unhinged that lead to the main character doing stuff that normal people would not do. But in this movie that mostly comes from the main character really never getting that he is probably the worst person in the world and that he is the machine that feeds the killing even if he is not the one pulling the trigger. I sota liked this but in the end it is not the type of Cage that I would prefer but it was not bad.

## Primal
Over all, this was a fun, yet silly movie where the acting was mostly pretty sub par and a bit over the top. Nic Cage has some seriously bad Phrases that he says in this which are very over acted. This movie has the person that plays Gene Grey from the Original XMen movies and Nic Cage. So that was pretty interesting. This is a movie that is something that I would have never dreamed up but that is what people who are crative are for. 

The premis of this movie is that Nic Cage is a pocher/hunter of rare aminals and sells them to people who will pay a lot of money for them. While getting his latest big catch home, a while "Jag", as he says in the movie, home on a boat the NSA is trying to bring home one of their super killers that they unleased on the world to kill people and then went rouge when they told him to stop killing. With a boat full of Rare deadly animals and a super killer nothing could go wrong.

The acting for the most part in this movie is pretty bad on all fronts from most of the people in the movie. But, yet, I still liked it. Also I learned that Venomous snakes will always search out people to kill. They would never just avoid peopole. They will ALWAYS find someone to bite because what other purpose could the venom that they have be used for. This is something that I will make sure to keep with me for if I were to see any venomous snakes in the future.

**BEGIN SPOILERS**

Basically, the super killer gets loose and frees all the animals on the boat. Cage is more focused on getting the animals back than the fact that a phycotic murder machine is loose. He is determined to get his Jag back so that he can have his big payday and then buy the house of his dreams and fish every day and then flaunt that in the face of his father who thought that he would amount to nothing. 

While this is happening the super killer kills all the trained people on the boat as the movie goes on and Nic slowly becomes a better human through the infulence of the love interest in the movie. He slowly turns into someone that would like to help all the remaining people on the boat beat the bad guy and get off safely. This is the point in the movie where Cage gets to hunt the super killer and prove that he is the best hunter of all time! Hunting the most dangerous prey.... Super NSA Murder Machines.

In the end Cage uses all the tricks that he uses to catch animals to drug the super killer so that he can beat him in MORTAL COMBAT.

**END SPOILERS**

### Enjoyability - 6/10
I enjoyed this a bit. It is not a good movie, not at all, but it is a good bad movie. It is in that genera of movies where I think that they must have known that what they were making was not supposed to be good. But just different and somewhat enjoyable. I think that if you like watching bad movies and can enjoy them being bad but not bad in the the wrong ways this is something that you could throw on, watch it one time and then say that you have seen it and move on with life.

### Artistic Merit - 0/10
Yeah, lets be real about this, There is nothing to be found here. The movie on a a ship in the ocean and the small amount of the movie that is not there is in the most generic bland jungle that you have ever seen. Even the fight scenes are pretty meh for the most part. 

### The Cageness - 8/10
This is one of those movies like Wally's Wonderland where Cage is playing a character to his near maximum Cageness. The main character of this is what I would think some people would think is over acted but it is Just Nic Cage being Nic Cage. He has tons of odd faces that he makes in this movie that sometimes really do not fit the things that are going on at the moment in time. He says a bunch of odd phrases in the movie that seem very over the top but again I feel like are something that Nic Cage must just really like saying. I am not sure. But in movies like this he really seems to like over acting these types of characters and I personally like watching these types of Cage movies.

## National Treasure

I would assume that everyone that is about to read this has seen this movie but if that is not the case I would recommend that you go watch it before you read this. I will not spoil much but I think that this movie is actually really great and holds a special place in the history of all the crazy conspiracy theory people, or it must have in some way influenced them. In watching this I am convinced that the person/people who wrote this must love looking at conspiracy theories but know how much bullshit they are. I am likel wrong about this but I feel like you could not craft something like this without being a little conspiracy theory crazy.

The premis of this movie is that he worlds most consumed family got this thing from one of the founding father that told them the key to finding the biggest treasure that has ever existed. And this family has spent their whole lives over multiple generations trying to find it with what would seem to be little luck. Bengemin Franklen Gates (Nic Cage) finds out about this from his Grandfather and that sets him on the course to find the National Treasure that has been building over the course of all of time. 

The movie mostly goes through the action adventure process of finding this treasure and is pretty good about it. The main character is some wizard about tying pieces of information together that could mean 1 of 1000 thing but always figures out what they actually mean on like the first or second thought that he has about them. Making it look like he could absouletly just have gone onto Jepordy and made his fourtune instead of going through the process that he is right now. That being said, there is something wonderful about the way that they make this in the movie because this only really bothers me after the fact in thinking about it. But, while watching the movie it did not bother me at all. It is done in some way that makes it not completely glaring, to me at least, that it is complete and utter nonsense that they seem to be pulling out of his hat.

Final note, I think that one of the best parts about this movie is that when they are first dealing with the Declaration of Independcnce they are super careful and making sure to not touch it with their hands, but as the movie goes on they just get less and less careful to the point where I think that the people making the movie where thinking, "Man, this having to be careful shit with this thing is killing the flow of the movie." and likely just stopped caring about being careful at all. To the point where they just unroll and touch it with their hands all the fucking time during the middle and end of this movie.

### Enjoyability - 9/10
I love this movie. I thought that going back and watching it now many years later would have made me think less of this but this movie is really fun, super engaging and keeps your attention on the movie at all times. It moves fast and never really slows down. I think that is what makes this move feel so good to watch. Even at two hours it went by really fast when watching.

### Artistic Merit - 8/10
I think that whoever made this had a lot of fun doing all the things that they did in it because a lot of the things in the movie feel like they are very artistic but not in the cinema why but more in the crafting of the sets of the movie and all the other things about it. I think that it is really well put together. A lot of the sets and the thing going on take place in existing places but the places that they come up with inside of some of those places are fun and pretty in their own ways.

### The Cageness - 9/10
I think that Cage is very Cage in this movie and it is not in the way that some of his movie are where he is just an insane madman with super over the top acting. In this he is over the top but the acting is really good. The main character just fits him well. I think that evne when Cage is being crazy, Like saying, "We are going to steal the Declaration of Independcnce" you just can't help but be like, YEAH, fucking steal that shit! You got this! 

I also think that you get a lot of great Crazy Cage looks in this movie but they are coming from a place where he is not insane but he has some insane idea and he is going to act on it and nothing can stop him.
